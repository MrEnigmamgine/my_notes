The artificial intelligence algorithms will also be used to further improve diagnosis over time, via an application of machine learning called precision medicine. A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others. [r] AI founder John McCarthy said: \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence, is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. The main agenda for these scientific diplomacy efforts is to bolster research on artificial intelligence and how it can be utilized in cybersecurity research, development, and overall consumer trust.\n"
